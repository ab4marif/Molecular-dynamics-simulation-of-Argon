# Weekly progress journal

## Instructions

In this journal you will document your progress of the project, making use of the weekly milestones.

Every week you should 

1. write down **on Wednesday** a short plan (bullet list is sufficient) of how you want to 
   reach the weekly milestones. Think about how to distribute work in the group, 
   what pieces of code functionality need to be implemented. 
2. write about your progress **before** the Tuesday in the next week with respect to the milestones.
   Substantiate your progress with links to code, pictures or test results. Reflect on the
   relation to your original plan.

We will give feedback on your progress on Tuesday before the following lecture. Consult the 
[grading scheme](https://computationalphysics.quantumtinkerer.tudelft.nl/proj1-moldyn-grading/) 
for details how the journal enters your grade.

Note that the file format of the journal is *markdown*. This is a flexible and easy method of 
converting text to HTML. 
Documentation of the syntax of markdown can be found 
[here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#gfm-extends-standard-markdown). 
You will find how to include [links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#links) and 
[images](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#images) particularly
useful.

## Week 1
(due before 18 February)

- We will store each particles velocity and postion in a 1xN dimensional array. For the initial values we will use a gaussian distribution. This will be done by Kadhim

- first differentiate the lennard jones potential analytically, then we use that to calculate the force. For this we need the distance for the nearest neighbor. We will examine the elements of the position vector and subtract each element to get the shortest distance. This will be done by Achmed

-  for this task a for loop will be used to calculate the time evolution for both position and velocity. This will be done by Kadhim

- We set up a box of lenght L. Once a particle crosses the boundary we will subtract the length of the box to that particle. This will be done by Achmed

- The energy function will consist of the kinetic energy and potential(lennard jones potential). This will be done by both of us
